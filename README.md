 <h4> Innovation. Security. Heritage. History. Simplicity. Beauty. Scarcity. Maple.

--------------------------------------------------------------------

Description.
"Pride. Trust. Heritage. Stability. Canada. Maple."



Maple is planned to be a stable, low-fee (or no fee), cryptocurrency.



Maple will be a coin, which has no fees at all, or an erc20 token with low transaction costs of the Ethereum block-chain. 

Coin or token will be decided by the supporting community, based on amount/level of community development. 

Maple is preferably an alt-coin in the future, with its own block-chain (forked from cryptonote), in order to achieve goal of 0 transaction costs; unlike Ethereum's block-chain, with Gas costs.)



Project Maple is unique and useful as it consists of a main currency, "Maple," which is pegged to and is backed with Canadian Dollars (fiat-backed stable-coin), and two (child) sub-currencies to "Maple;" "Maple Gold," backed with physical pure gold, and "Maple Silver," backed with pure, physical silver. Both sub-currencies of "Maple", 'Gold' and 'Silver,' are pegged to the value of precious metals, minted by the Royal Canadian Mint. (Commodity-backed stable-coins.)



The project will be possible by community supporters, donors, and developers, who will be rewarded at the project's launch.

<h3> Project Maple | Specs & Currencies.


Maple.

The main, fiat-backed cryptocurrency of Maple.



- All coins are backed by 1 CAD.

- 5000 CAD initially, ready to back each coin/token (5000 in initial circulation, with remainder of total of 500,000,000 tokens/coins in lock-up, uncirculated.)

- ZERO fees (if project is launched as an alt-coin with independent block-chain), or low Ethereum transaction fees (if project is launched as an erc20 token).

- Stable value, pegged to the value of 1 Canadian Dollar (CAD).

- Useful and essential asset stable-coin; no POW (low carbon footprint), limited and controlled supply (each coin/token is backed by a genuine Canadian Dollar)

- Fast payments (great for merchants/sellers and consumers).

- Private.

- Community built and maintained.

- Open-sourced.

- International.

- Development relies only on and project is expanded through direct donations and contributions (non-profit).

- Ready for the increasingly complex worlds of today and tomorrow.

- All Canadian Dollars (used for backing) are secured by Toronto-Dominion (TD) Bank.

- All CAD backing funds is fully insured by the Canadian Government, through Canada Deposit Insurance Corporation (CDIC).

<h4> Maple Premier. | Precious Metals Stable-Coins.

Maple Gold.

Cryptocurrency meets (and backed by) premier material.



- Sub-currency (child) of Maple.

- Commodity-backed stable-coin.

- All coins/tokens are backed by a physical troy ounce of pure (.9999) gold.

- Each single Maple Gold coin/token is pegged to the physical value of a single 1 ounce Gold Maple Leaf Coin, minted by the Royal Canadian Mint.

- Gold purity and amount is guaranteed by the Canadian Government, through the Royal Canadian Mint.

- All precious metal assets are heavily secured and fully insured by Brink's, through Brink's Precious Metals Storage.

- All metal content is stored at the Toronto-based Brink's Vault.



Maple Silver.

Affordable access to the stability and interest rate of pure silver bullion.



- Sub-currency (child) of Maple.
- Commodity-backed stable-coin.
- All coins/tokens are backed by a physical troy ounce of pure (.9999) silver.
- Each single Maple Silver coin/token is pegged to the physical value of a single 1 ounce Silver Maple Leaf Coin, minted by the Royal Canadian Mint.
- Silver purity and amount is guaranteed by the Canadian Government, through the Royal Canadian Mint.
- All precious metal assets are heavily secured and fully insured by Brink's, through Brink's Precious Metals Storage.
- All metal content is stored at the Toronto-based Brink's Vault.


--------------------------------------------------------



If Maple and its sub-currencies are launched as a coin with an independent block-chain, our blockchain will be forked from the crypto-note foundation's template cryptocurrency. This requires more community support through development codes and nodes. However, this allows for zero transaction costs, more transparency of code, higher privacy of transactions, and more customization. (Preferred)



If Maple and its sub-currencies are launched as erc20 tokens, they will operate with transaction fees of the Ethereum block-chain. This method requires less code, but higher funding, mainly through Ethereum (ETH).

Fund this project.


The main and most important method of funding The Maple Project is through development contributions, such as code or running nodes (knowledge and community support are superpowers).



Using cryptocurrency, donations are appreciated, perferably through Ethereum, or a stable-coin, perferably USDC, or DAI.



(Yes, we are aware that there are no Canadian Dollar stable-coins, Maple will be a CAD-pegged and backed stable-coin! :D)
